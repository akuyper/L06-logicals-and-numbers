## Overview

The goal of this lab is to explore practice using two important variable types that you'll encounter inside data frames: logicals and numerics vectors. Logicals are the simplest types of vectors, but are extremely powerful. It's relatively rare to find logical vectors in your raw data, but youâ€™ll create and manipulate them in the course of almost every analysis. Numerics are the backbone of data science and is the type of data type that most think of when it comes to data science. 

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L06_logicals_numbers.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L06.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
